# Adult Census Income ML Classification Model 💵

## 📑 Overview:
This was the final project I submitted for Break Through Tech's Machine Learning Foundations course, where I aimed to apply all the machine learning skills/techniques I learned from the course into building an end-to-end ML classification pipeline from a real-life, relevant dataset. In this project, my goal was to use the Adult Census Income dataset to develop a binary classifier that predicted whether a person's income exceeded 50K, based on a variety of features like age, years of education, occupation, and capital gain/loss. To build the classifier, I performed EDA, data preprocssing to handle 30,000+ entries in the data set, feature engineering, model training, validation, and selection - making use of Python ML libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib to train models and perform data visualizations. 

## 🌐 Relevance 
This supervised ML problem holds real-world relevance because the insights extracted from my findings could help companies better understand consumer behavior/patterns, enabling them to tailor advertising strategies that maximize impact and effectiveness on target audiences. Having information about who is likely to make over 50K and who isn't would allow a company to identify future customers who are more likely to afford and purchase its products, helping them focus their advertising efforts on high-potential consumers. For instance, a company that sells luxury, high-end designer products could use this information to concentrate the majority of their advertising on audiences with higher income levels who are more likely to purchase such products.

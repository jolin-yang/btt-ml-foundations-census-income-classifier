# Adult Census Income ML Classification Model

## Overview:
This was the final project I submitted for Break Through Tech's Machine Learning Foundations course, where I aimed to apply all the machine learning skills/techniques I learned from the course into building an end-to-end ML classification pipeline from a real-life, relevant dataset. In this project, my goal was to use the Adult Census Income dataset to develop a binary classifier that predicted whether a person's income exceeded 50K, based on a variety of features like age, years of education, occupation, and capital gain/loss. To build the classifier, I performed EDA, data preprocssing to handle 30,000+ entries in the data set, feature engineering, model training, validation, and selection - making use of Python ML libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib to train models and perform data visualizations.
